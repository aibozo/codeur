# Code Planner Implementation Status

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

The Code Planner agent has been successfully implemented and tested! This agent transforms high-level Plans from the Request Planner into detailed CodingTasks for the Coding Agents.

### Architecture

```
Plan (from Request Planner) → Code Planner → TaskBundle → Coding Agents
```

### Components Implemented

1. **AST Analyzer** (`ast_analyzer.py`)
   - Language-agnostic code analysis framework
   - Python AST parsing with full symbol extraction
   - Basic JavaScript analysis with regex
   - Call graph building
   - Complexity analysis (cyclomatic complexity)
   - Impact analysis for changed files

2. **Task Generator** (`task_generator.py`)
   - Converts Plan steps into CodingTasks
   - Dependency analysis between tasks
   - Skeleton patch generation for hints
   - Complexity scoring and token estimation
   - Execution strategy determination (parallel/sequential/topological)

3. **Code Planner Core** (`code_planner.py`)
   - Main orchestration logic
   - Git integration for commit tracking
   - File analysis coordination
   - Task validation

4. **Messaging Service** (`messaging_service.py`)
   - Consumes from `code.plan.in` topic
   - Produces to `coding.task.in` topic
   - Dead letter queue handling
   - Metrics tracking

5. **CLI Interface** (`cli.py`)
   - Process plans from JSON files
   - Analyze individual files
   - Run as messaging service
   - Generate sample plans for testing

### Test Results

✅ **AST Analyzer Test**
- Successfully parsed Python code
- Extracted functions, classes, and methods
- Calculated complexity metrics
- Identified function calls

✅ **Code Planner Integration Test**
- Successfully consumed Plan from message queue
- Generated TaskBundle with 2 tasks
- Correctly identified affected files
- Assigned appropriate complexity levels
- Emitted TaskBundle to `coding.task.in` topic

### Message Flow Demonstrated

```
1. Test Plan created with 2 steps:
   - Refactor process_data function
   - Add unit tests

2. Code Planner generated TaskBundle:
   - Task 1: Refactor task for src/data_processor.py
   - Task 2: Test creation task
   - Execution strategy: parallel (no dependencies)

3. TaskBundle emitted to coding.task.in topic
```

### Features

1. **Smart Task Generation**
   - Analyzes code structure to understand impact
   - Generates skeleton patches as hints
   - Calculates realistic complexity scores

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Detects when tasks must run sequentially
   - Supports parallel execution when possible
   - Uses topological ordering for complex dependencies

3. **Language Support**
   - Full Python support with AST parsing
   - Basic support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, etc.
   - Extensible framework for adding languages

4. **Integration**
   - Seamless integration with message queue
   - Protobuf serialization
   - Dead letter queue for error handling

### Fixed Issues

1. **Protobuf Compatibility** ✅
   - Updated protoc from 3.12.4 to 25.3
   - Map fields now work correctly
   - Metadata fields fully functional
   - Tasks now include:
     - `step_kind`: The type of step that generated the task
     - `affected_symbols`: Comma-separated list of code symbols affected

2. **Language Support**
   - Only Python has full AST analysis
   - Other languages use basic regex parsing
   - Tree-sitter integration needed for better parsing

3. **RAG Integration**
   - RAG service integration stubbed but not connected
   - Blob IDs for pre-fetched context not populated

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**
   - Update protobuf compiler to fix map fields
   - Add tree-sitter for multi-language AST parsing
   - Connect to RAG service when available

2. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add caching with Redis
   - Implement parallel AST parsing
   - Add more sophisticated dependency detection
   - Support for cross-file refactoring

## Summary

The Code Planner is fully functional and successfully bridges the gap between high-level Plans and executable CodingTasks. It demonstrates sophisticated code analysis capabilities and proper integration with the distributed message queue architecture. The agent is ready to support the next stage: the Coding Agent implementation.
