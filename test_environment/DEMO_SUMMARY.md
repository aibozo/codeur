# Agent System Demo Summary

## What We Built

A complete multi-agent system for automated code changes with:

### 1. **Message Queue Infrastructure**
- Kafka and in-memory implementations
- Protocol Buffers for serialization
- Topic-based message routing

### 2. **Agent Pipeline**
```
Change Request → Request Planner → Plan → Code Planner → Tasks → Coding Agent → Commits
```

### 3. **Three Working Agents**

#### Request Planner
- Receives natural language change requests
- Creates structured implementation plans
- Analyzes codebase context

#### Code Planner  
- Converts plans into concrete coding tasks
- Performs AST analysis with tree-sitter
- Generates skeleton patches
- Uses Redis caching and parallel processing

#### Coding Agent
- Executes individual coding tasks
- Gathers context with RAG
- Generates patches with LLM
- Validates changes (syntax, linting, tests)
- Creates git commits

### 4. **Testing Environment**
- Terminal UIs for each agent
- Orchestrator for coordination
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Test scenarios and sample repository

## Demo Results

Running the demo showed:

1. **Message Flow Working** ✅
   - Change request successfully processed
   - Plan created with 3 steps
   - Task bundle generated with 3 tasks
   - Each task has skeleton patches

2. **Code Analysis Working** ✅
   - AST parsing of Python files
   - Function detection and complexity analysis
   - Import tracking
   - Call graph generation (with NetworkX)

3. **Without LLM** (current demo)
   - System generates skeleton patches
   - Shows where code changes would go
   - Validates the pipeline works end-to-end

4. **With LLM** (when API key provided)
   - Would generate actual code patches
   - Create real git commits
   - Full automation of code changes

## Terminal UI Features

The rich terminal interfaces show:
- Live agent status
- Message processing metrics
- Recent activity logs
- Performance statistics
- Error tracking

## Next Steps

To see full functionality:
1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Run the test scenarios
3. Watch agents generate real code changes

The system is ready for:
- Test Planner agent (analyze what tests are needed)
- Test Builder agent (generate test code)
- Production deployment with Kafka
- Scaling to multiple repositories
