# LLM Integration Status

## âœ… Completed

We've successfully integrated OpenAI's LLM capabilities into the Request Planner, transforming it into a Claude Code/Codex style intelligent agent.

### What's Working

1. **LLM-Powered Planning**
   - Uses o3 model for complex planning tasks
   - Generates detailed, actionable implementation plans
   - Properly handles function calling for structured output
   - Falls back to heuristics if LLM fails

2. **Code Analysis & Explanation**
   - New `explain` command for asking questions about the codebase
   - Uses gpt-4o for code understanding and explanation
   - Searches relevant code context automatically

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Supports `.env` file for API keys
   - Configurable models via environment variables
   - Proper error messages when API key is missing

4. **Model Compatibility**
   - Special handling for o3 model requirements:
     - Uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
     - Forces temperature=1 (o3 requirement)
   - Backward compatible with gpt-4o and other models

### Available Commands

```bash
# Create implementation plans
poetry run agent plan "Add error handling to the API"

# Submit change requests (with optional --dry-run)
poetry run agent request --dry-run "Refactor the authentication module"

# Ask questions about the code
poetry run agent explain "How does the Request Planner work?"

# Search the codebase
poetry run agent search "context retriever"

# Check status
poetry run agent status
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
PLANNING_MODEL=o3          # or gpt-4o
GENERAL_MODEL=gpt-4o       # for explain command
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Example Output

The o3 model provides extremely detailed plans with:
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Specific code hints and patterns
- File-level impact analysis
- Testing requirements
- Migration strategies

### Next Steps

1. **Enhance Context Retrieval**
   - Implement semantic search
   - Add code understanding features
   - Improve snippet extraction

2. **Add Execution Capabilities**
   - Simple file modifications
   - Code generation preview
   - Validation and testing

3. **Interactive Features**
   - Chat mode for conversational interaction
   - Code review capabilities
   - Suggestion system

The Request Planner now functions as an intelligent coding assistant that can understand requests, analyze code, and create detailed implementation plans using state-of-the-art language models.
