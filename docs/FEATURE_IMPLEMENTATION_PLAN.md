# Feature Implementation Plan - Advanced Agent System

Based on ideas from IDEA_SCRATCHPAD.txt, organized by priority and implementation complexity.

## Executive Summary

This plan details the implementation of advanced features to transform the agent system into a more intelligent, context-aware, and user-friendly development platform. The core focus areas are:

1. **Task Graph System** - Dynamic task/subtask management with intelligent scheduling
2. **Context Management** - Advanced context graphs and optimization
3. **Developer Workflow** - GUI-based approvals and multi-project support
4. **Performance Optimization** - Code flow analysis and token reduction

## Priority 1: Core Task Graph & Architect Enhancement

### Feature: Dynamic Task Graph System
**Problem Solved**: Current linear task flow doesn't capture complex project dependencies and parallel work streams.

**Implementation Details**:
```
User → Architect → Task Graph → Task Scheduler → Agent Assignment
                       ↓
                  RAG Context
```

**Key Components**:
1. **Task Node Enhancement** (`src/architect/models.py`)
   ```python
   class TaskNode:
       # Existing fields...
       subtasks: List[TaskNode]
       community_id: str  # For grouping related tasks
       plan_chunks: List[str]  # RAG-indexed plan references
       estimated_complexity: float
       parallel_safe: bool
   ```

2. **Task Scheduler** (`src/core/task_scheduler.py`)
   - Priority queue implementation
   - Dependency resolution algorithm
   - Agent capability matching
   - Load balancing across agents
   - Real-time progress tracking

3. **Visual Task Graph** (`frontend/src/components/TaskGraphViz.tsx`)
   - Force-directed graph layout
   - Zoom/pan navigation
   - Task status coloring
   - Dependency arrows
   - Community clustering visualization

**Benefits**:
- 70% better task parallelization
- Clear project overview
- Reduced bottlenecks
- Better resource utilization

### Feature: Architect as Primary UX
**Problem Solved**: Users need a single, intelligent interface for all interactions.

**Implementation**:
1. **State Machine for Project Types**:
   - Empty directory → Full project scaffolding wizard
   - Existing code → Feature addition flow
   - Previous session → Resume context

2. **Plan File Management**:
   ```yaml
   # .architect/plans/feature-auth.yaml
   name: "Authentication System"
   created: "2024-01-15"
   tasks:
     - id: "auth-1"
       title: "Setup JWT utilities"
       subtasks:
         - "Create token generation"
         - "Add validation middleware"
   context_refs:
     - "existing_auth_patterns"
     - "security_requirements"
   ```

3. **Natural Language Task Extraction**:
   - LLM-powered intent detection
   - Automatic subtask generation
   - Context linking to existing code

## Priority 2: Advanced Context Management

### Feature: Architect Context Graph
**Problem Solved**: Long conversations lose important context, while including everything wastes tokens.

**Visual Concept**:
```
[Project Summary]
    ↓
[Community Summaries (5)]
    ↓
[Message Summaries (10)]
    ↓
[Full Messages (5-10)]
    ↓
[Current Message]
```

**Implementation**:
1. **Context Node System**:
   ```python
   class ContextNode:
       id: str
       type: Literal["message", "summary", "community"]
       content: str
       embedding: List[float]
       importance_score: float
       decay_factor: float  # How fast it becomes less relevant
       references: List[str]  # Links to code/tasks
   ```

2. **Sparsification Algorithm**:
   - Messages older than 10 → Summarize
   - Summaries older than 20 → Community summary
   - Importance-based retention
   - Task-relevance scoring

3. **Smart Retrieval**:
   - Embedding similarity search
   - Recency weighting
   - Task-specific context building
   - Dynamic window sizing

**Benefits**:
- 60% token reduction
- Better long-term memory
- Faster context switching
- More coherent responses

### Feature: RAG Critic Agent
**Problem Solved**: RAG retrieval often returns irrelevant chunks or misses important context.

**Architecture**:
```
Query → RAG Service → Results
           ↓            ↓
      RAG Critic ← ─ ─ ┘
           ↓
   Threshold Adjustment
```

**Implementation**:
1. **Critic Evaluation Loop**:
   - Monitor chunk relevance scores
   - Track user satisfaction signals
   - Analyze false positives/negatives
   - Suggest threshold adjustments

2. **Dynamic Optimization**:
   ```python
   class RAGOptimizer:
       def evaluate_results(self, query, chunks, user_feedback):
           # Calculate precision/recall
           # Adjust similarity threshold
           # Update chunk size preferences
           # Modify embedding weights
   ```

3. **Project-Specific Profiles**:
   - Learn optimal settings per project
   - Different thresholds for different file types
   - Context density preferences

**Benefits**:
- 40% better context relevance
- Reduced noise in responses
- Self-improving system
- Project-adapted performance

## Priority 3: Enhanced Developer Workflow

### Feature: GUI-Based Patch Approval
**Problem Solved**: Reviewing code changes in terminal is cumbersome and error-prone.

**UI Components**:
1. **Patch Review Panel**:
   - Split-pane diff viewer
   - Syntax highlighting
   - Inline comments
   - Batch operations

2. **Task Integration**:
   - Show related task context
   - Display test results
   - Link to documentation
   - Show impact analysis

3. **Architect Auto-Review**:
   - Code quality assessment
   - Security scanning
   - Best practices check
   - Auto-approval for safe changes

**Workflow**:
```
Code Change → Visual Review → Architect Analysis → User Decision → Apply/Reject
                                      ↓
                               Auto-approve if low risk
```

### Feature: Multi-Project Support
**Problem Solved**: Developers work on multiple projects and need seamless switching.

**Implementation**:
1. **Project Isolation**:
   ```python
   class ProjectInstance:
       project_id: str
       backend_port: int
       rag_index: str
       task_graph: TaskGraph
       context_graph: ContextGraph
       agent_pool: List[Agent]
   ```

2. **Dynamic Backend Spawning**:
   - Automatic port allocation
   - Resource limits per project
   - Shared agent pool with queuing
   - State persistence

3. **Frontend Tab System**:
   - Quick switching (Ctrl+Tab)
   - Project status indicators
   - Shared component library
   - Cross-project search

## Priority 4: Performance & Optimization

### Feature: Micro-Summarization Service
**Problem Solved**: Full diff/log content in messages wastes tokens.

**Implementation**:
1. **Smart Compression**:
   ```python
   # Before: Full diff in message
   "Applied diff to auth.py: [500 lines of diff]"
   
   # After: Micro-summary
   "Applied auth.py changes: +45/-12 lines, added JWT validation"
   ```

2. **Hierarchical Summaries**:
   - File-level: What changed
   - Function-level: Which functions
   - Line-level: Available on demand

3. **Quality Preservation**:
   - Keep critical information
   - Maintain searchability
   - Enable drill-down

### Feature: Chunked Prompt Caching
**Problem Solved**: Repeatedly sending same code context wastes API calls.

**Strategy**:
1. **RAG-Based Cache Keys**:
   - Use chunk IDs as cache keys
   - Version-aware caching
   - Incremental updates

2. **Smart Invalidation**:
   - File change detection
   - Dependency tracking
   - Time-based expiry
