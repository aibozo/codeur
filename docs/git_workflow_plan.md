# Git Workflow Plan for Multi-Agent System

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive Git workflow designed for the multi-agent coding system. The workflow ensures safety, reversibility, and provides a clean user experience while maintaining professional development practices.

## Core Requirements
1. **Initialization**: Create a working branch at startup (never use main directly)
2. **Safety**: All changes must be reversible and traceable
3. **Branch Hierarchy**: Agents can only merge to working branch, architect can merge to main with user approval
4. **User Experience**: Visual git graph, easy reversion, save points
5. **Gitless Mode**: Option to disable Git operations entirely

## Branch Hierarchy and Naming Conventions

### Branch Structure
```
main (protected - requires architect + user approval)
└── working/session-[timestamp]-[user-id]
    ├── task/[task-id]/[short-description]
    ├── fix/[issue-id]/[short-description]
    ├── experiment/[experiment-id]/[description]
    └── checkpoint/[timestamp]-[description]
```

### Branch Types
- **main**: Production-ready code, protected branch
- **working/session-***: Active development branch for current session
- **task/***: Individual task implementations
- **fix/***: Bug fixes and issue resolutions
- **experiment/***: Experimental features or approaches
- **checkpoint/***: Save points for recovery

### Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for descriptions
- Include task/issue IDs for traceability
- Keep descriptions under 50 characters
- Examples:
  - `task/abc123/add-user-authentication`
  - `fix/bug-456/resolve-memory-leak`
  - `checkpoint/2024-01-15-1430-before-refactor`

## Commit Strategy

### Atomic Commits
Each task results in exactly one commit containing all related changes:

```python
# Commit message format
[TASK-{task_id}] {description}

Agent: {agent_type}
Task: {task_description}
Files: {modified_files}
Tests: {test_status}

{detailed_description}
```

### Commit Metadata
Store in commit message or Git notes:
- Task ID
- Agent responsible
- Timestamp
- Dependencies
- Test results
- Reversion information

## Merge Strategy

### Agent Merge Rules
1. **Coding Agent**: Can merge task branches → working branch
2. **Test Agent**: Can merge test branches → working branch
3. **Fix Agent**: Can merge fix branches → working branch
4. **Architect**: Can merge working → main (with user approval)

### Merge Process
1. Create task branch from working branch
2. Implement changes
3. Run safety checks
4. Create atomic commit
5. Merge to working branch (squash merge for clean history)
6. Delete task branch
7. Update task tracking

### Conflict Resolution
- Automatic resolution for non-overlapping changes
- Agent collaboration for complex conflicts
- Architect escalation for critical conflicts
- User intervention as last resort

## Reversion Mechanism

### Task-Level Reversion
```python
# Revert a specific task
def revert_task(task_id: str):
    1. Find commit for task_id
    2. Check dependencies
    3. Create revert commit
    4. Update task status
    5. Notify relevant agents
```

### Cascade Reversion
Handle dependent tasks:
1. Identify all dependent tasks
2. Revert in reverse dependency order
3. Maintain system consistency
4. Create checkpoint after reversion

### Selective Reversion
- Revert specific files from a task
- Preserve test changes while reverting implementation
- Cherry-pick specific changes

## Save Points/Checkpoint System

### Automatic Checkpoints
Created automatically at:
- Session start
- Before major refactoring
- After successful test suite runs
- Before risky operations
- End of session

### Manual Checkpoints
Users can create named checkpoints:
```bash
# Create checkpoint
git checkpoint create "before-adding-payment-system"

# List checkpoints
git checkpoint list

# Restore checkpoint
git checkpoint restore "before-adding-payment-system"
```

### Checkpoint Storage
- Branch: `checkpoint/[timestamp]-[description]`
- Includes full project state
- Metadata about session context
- Can be converted to permanent tags

## Visual Representation

### Terminal Git Graph
```
* [main] Latest stable release
|
| * [working/session-2024-01-15-user123] Current session
| |\
| | * [task/abc123/add-auth] Add authentication
| | |
| | * [checkpoint/2024-01-15-1430] Auto-checkpoint
| |/
| * [task/xyz789/fix-bug] Fix login bug (merged)
|/
* Previous release
```

### HTML Interactive Visualization
- D3.js-based git graph
- Clickable commits for details
- Agent activity indicators
- Task progress tracking
- Reversion buttons
- Diff viewing

### Status Dashboard
```
Current Session: working/session-2024-01-15-user123
Active Tasks: 3
Completed Tasks: 12
Last Checkpoint: 30 minutes ago
Agents Active: Coding, Testing
```

## Safety Checks and Guards

### Pre-Commit Checks
1. **Secret Detection**: Scan for API keys, passwords
2. **Large File Check**: Prevent commits over 10MB
3. **Syntax Validation**: Ensure code compiles
4. **Test Status**: Warn if tests failing
5. **Code Quality**: Basic linting checks

### Pre-Merge Checks
1. **Conflict Detection**: Check for merge conflicts
2. **Test Suite**: Run relevant tests
3. **Coverage**: Ensure coverage doesn't decrease
4. **Dependencies**: Verify dependency compatibility
5. **Security**: Run security scans

### Branch Protection Rules
- No force pushes to main or working branches
- Require reviews for main branch merges
- Prevent deletion of main and active working branches
- Enforce linear history on main

## Integration with Agent Workflow

### Initialization Flow
```python
1. User starts session
2. System creates working/session-[timestamp]-[user] branch
3. All agents configured to use this branch
4. Visual status shows active branch
5. Auto-checkpoint created
```

### Task Execution Flow
```python
1. Task assigned to agent
2. Agent creates task/[id]/[desc] branch
3. Agent implements changes
4. Safety checks run automatically
5. Atomic commit created
6. Merge to working branch
7. Task marked complete
8. Branch cleaned up
```

### Session Completion Flow
```python
1. User indicates session end
2. Final tests run
3. Checkpoint created
4. Summary report generated
5. Option to merge to main
6. Cleanup temporary branches
```
